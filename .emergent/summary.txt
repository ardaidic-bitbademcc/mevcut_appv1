The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive employee management application, starting from an initial React component. The development followed an iterative approach, addressing user requests for core functionalities like employee management, task assignment, and shift scheduling. Key milestones included integrating a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, implementing detailed salary calculations, drag-and-drop shift scheduling with PDF export, multi-person task and shift assignments, recurring tasks with custom periods, and displaying leaves on the calendar. The engineer also implemented frontend validation for employee IDs and permission-based task viewing. The work currently focuses on building a stock management module and a user registration system, with backend logic and initial frontend components (tab, data fetching, register button) implemented, and the registration system awaiting testing.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a fully developed application, specifically a feature-rich, editable calendar with demo data, without special format constraints for IDs (later specified as 4-digit numbers). This evolved into a comprehensive employee management system.

**Implemented features based on explicit user requests:**
1.  **Core Employee Management:** Add, edit, view employees (with 4-digit numeric ID validation).
2.  **Detailed Salary System:** Calculate daily/hourly earnings, net salary, deduct advances, add meal allowances per working day. Includes modals for managing advances and meal rates.
3.  **Task Management:** Assign tasks, view assigned tasks (filtered by user), create recurring tasks with customizable periods (e.g., 1 günde bir, 3 haftada bir).
4.  **Shift Management:** Create a feature-rich calendar with drag-and-drop shift assignment, display leaves, assign shifts to multiple employees, and export shifts as PDF.
5.  **User Interface:** Intuitive dashboard with distinct tabs for functionalities, a kiosk feature for employee check-in/out.

**Current development (pending completion):**
1.  **Stock Management Module:** A dedicated page for authorized users (Kerem, Arda) to track and count stock items, with admin ability to manage inventory, define products (e.g., Cola 34 units, Davinci strawberry puree 780 grams), and units (kg, gram, adet).
2.  **User Registration:** A Register button on the login screen, allowing new users to sign up with email, name, surname, and ID (mandatory), without initially setting salary or position (to be assigned by admin).

Codebase Structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the core FastAPI backend application. It defines all API endpoints, data models (using Pydantic), and handles interactions with the MongoDB database. It is central to all data operations and business logic.
    -   **Summary of changes:** Extensively modified to include new Pydantic models and API endpoints for:
        -   Employee management (CRUD, including new registration endpoint).
        -   Task management (create, view, multiple assignment, recurring tasks with custom periods).
        -   Shift management (create, view, delete, advanced data for PDF export).
        -   Detailed salary calculations, including  and  models, and their respective CRUD operations.
        -   Stock management (, ,  models and endpoints).
        -   Seed data was consistently updated to populate the database with demo employees, roles, tasks, shifts, leaves, advances, meal allowances, and stock items.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the main React component, serving as the entry point for the frontend. It manages the overall application structure, including authentication state and importing primary components like .
    -   **Summary of changes:** Updated to correctly import and render the  component. Modified to accommodate login and logout logic, and most recently, to support navigation to the new registration form (implicit through  changes).

-   **/app/frontend/src/Dashboard.js**
    -   **Summary of importance:** This is the central dashboard component, housing the majority of the application's UI and client-side logic. It manages different tabs for various functionalities (Employees, Tasks, Shifts, Salary, Kiosk, Stock) and handles state and API calls.
    -   **Summary of changes:** This file underwent significant overhauls:
        -   Initial implementation based on a local state .
        -   Rewritten to integrate with all FastAPI backend APIs, replacing local state with fetched data.
        -   Implemented employee CRUD operations with client-side 4-digit numeric ID validation.
        -   Developed comprehensive task management UI, including multiple employee assignment, recurring task forms with customizable periods, and filtering tasks for individual employees.
        -   Created an advanced shift calendar with drag-and-drop functionality, visual display of employee leaves, multi-employee shift assignment, and the underlying logic for PDF export.
        -   Integrated a detailed salary module with UI for calculations, display of earnings, deductions, net salary, and interactive modals for adding advances and setting meal allowances.
        -   Added UI logic for user login and the new registration form.
        -   Implemented a Stock tab button with conditional rendering based on user roles and integrated functions to fetch stock data from the backend.

-   **/app/frontend/package.json**
    -   **Summary of importance:** Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    -   **Summary of changes:** Added  for simplified HTTP requests to the backend, and  and  libraries to enable client-side PDF generation for shift schedules.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the UI for the Stock Management Module, allowing admins to view/edit inventory, manage units, and for specific users to perform stock counts.
-   Implement and test the full user registration flow on the frontend, including form submission and user feedback.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on two major features: a comprehensive stock management system and a user registration functionality.

For **Stock Management**:
-   The backend () has been updated with new Pydantic models (, , ) and corresponding API endpoints for managing products, units, and stock counts.
-   Seed data has been extended to include example stock items.
-   On the frontend, the  file has been modified to include a Stock tab button in the navigation, and functions to fetch stock data have been integrated.
-   The UI for displaying, editing, and interacting with the stock inventory (e.g., showing counts, adding/editing units/products) is not yet built or visible to the user.

For **User Registration**:
-   A new registration endpoint () has been added to the backend ().
-   The frontend  has been updated to include the necessary state and logic for a registration form.
-   The login screen has been modified to present a Register button.
-   The last action taken by the AI engineer was restarting both the backend and frontend services, and the explicit next step mentioned was to test the registration system: Şimdi kayıt sistemini test edelim:. This indicates that the registration form is likely implemented in the UI but its full functionality (submission, error handling, redirection) needs verification.

<optional_next_step>
Test the newly implemented user registration system on the frontend.
