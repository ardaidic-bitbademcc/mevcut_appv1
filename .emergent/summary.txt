The AI engineer successfully expanded an employee management application from a basic React MVP. Initial work focused on implementing a comprehensive stock management module with backend models, API endpoints, and a detailed frontend UI, including category management and role-based permissions. Subsequently, the Kiosk functionality was redesigned: initially on the dashboard, then moved to the login page as a third button, and finally transformed into a dedicated kiosk user role login for multi-tenancy. The major architectural shift involved introducing a  for multi-tenancy, requiring extensive updates across all backend models and seed data. Debugging cycles predominantly focused on Pydantic validation errors due to missing  in various seeded data, old

<product_requirements>
The user initially sought a feature-rich, editable calendar, evolving into a comprehensive employee management system. Implemented core features include employee CRUD (with 4-digit ID validation), detailed salary calculation (with advances and meal allowances), task management (assignment, recurring tasks, filtering), and advanced shift management (drag-and-drop, leaves, PDF export). A dashboard with tabs for these functionalities and a kiosk for check-in/out were also built.

Recent explicit requests and their implementations:
1.  **Stock Management Module:** A dedicated section allowing authorized users (admin) to manage inventory, define products, units, and categories (now database-driven), and track stock counts. Frontend UI and backend APIs for this are largely complete.
2.  **User Registration:** A Register button on the login screen for new user sign-up (email, name, surname, ID), with salary/position set by admin later. The backend endpoint and frontend form logic are implemented.
3.  **Kiosk Redesign:** Moved the Kiosk functionality from the dashboard to a dedicated kiosk user login screen, accessible only via a special  account. It now allows employees to check-in/out via a 4-digit ID, with the screen clearing automatically post-action.
4.  **Multi-Tenancy:** Implemented a  system across all data models to support multiple independent companies, ensuring data isolation.
5.  **Branding Update:** Changed text on the login page (İK sistemi to Mevcut, removed demo accounts) and applied a new color palette throughout the UI.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and resolve the  error occurring after the latest branding changes, related to  validation on potentially old database records.
- Conduct thorough frontend testing for all new features (Stock Management, Kiosk user flow, Multi-tenancy isolation) after the current  error is resolved.
- Implement middleware in the backend to ensure  is automatically filtered for all GET requests and validated for all POST requests, aligning with the multi-tenancy architecture. (This was planned but not fully implemented in the trajectory).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a  error that occurred after applying branding and color changes to the application. The error is suspected to be due to existing, pre-multi-tenancy database records (e.g., attendance, advances) that lack the  field, causing Pydantic validation failures in the backend. The AI had already attempted to resolve similar  errors by ensuring all seed data correctly includes  and by running the seed-data endpoint. The current approach is to completely clear the database and then re-run the seed data to ensure all records have the necessary , explicitly avoiding a fork session as per the user's request. Concurrently, the login page has been updated to say Mevcut instead of İK sistemi and demo accounts have been removed, with the color palette updated to the new branding guidelines across the UI.

Completely clear the database and then re-run the  endpoint to resolve the  error.
