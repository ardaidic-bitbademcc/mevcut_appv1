# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Build a comprehensive Stock Management Module for the employee management system with the following requirements:
  1. Admin users should be able to view/edit inventory, manage products, manage units (kg, gram, adet)
  2. Specific users (Kerem ID=3, Arda ID=6) should be able to perform stock counts
  3. Display current stock levels with critical level warnings when stock falls below minimum
  4. All stock data should be persistent in MongoDB

      🎯 BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED (100% Success Rate)
      
      Comprehensive testing performed on all Stock Management backend APIs:
      
      ✅ Stock Units CRUD (3/3 endpoints tested):
      - GET /api/stok-birim: Successfully retrieves all units (5 found)
      - POST /api/stok-birim: Creates new units with proper validation
      - DELETE /api/stok-birim: Correctly prevents deletion of units in use, allows deletion of unused units
      
      ✅ Stock Products CRUD (4/4 endpoints tested):
      - GET /api/stok-urun: Successfully retrieves all products (7 found)
      - POST /api/stok-urun: Creates new products with all required fields
      - PUT /api/stok-urun: Updates existing products correctly
      - DELETE /api/stok-urun: Successfully deletes products
      
      ✅ Stock Count Operations (2/2 endpoints tested):
      - GET /api/stok-sayim/son-durum: Returns latest stock status with critical level detection (1 critical item: Çay)
      - POST /api/stok-sayim: Creates stock count records with proper sayim_yapan_id parameter
      
      🔐 Authentication: Admin login working correctly
      📊 Data Validation: All endpoints return proper JSON responses with expected fields
      ⚠️ Critical Stock Detection: Working correctly (items with stok_miktar <= min_stok marked as 'kritik')
      
      All backend APIs are fully functional and ready for production use.
